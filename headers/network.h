 * - hidden layer size is `HIDDEN_LAYER_SIZE`
 * - output layer size is `OUTPUT_LAYER_SIZE`
 *
 * Lifecycle contract:
 * 1. Zero-initialize the object before first use, for example:
 *    `Network net = {0};`
 * 2. Call `network_init(&net, input_size)` before training.
 * 3. Call `network_train(...)` only while the network is initialized.
 * 4. Call `network_free(&net)` when finished.
 *
 * Safe reinitialization:
 * - calling `network_init()` on an already initialized network is supported
 * - any previously owned layer buffers are released before new ones are
 *   allocated
 * - after `network_free()`, the network may be initialized again
